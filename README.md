Deep fake

Some funny experiment reproduction. This is based on paper https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8935-first-order-motion-model-for-image-animation

I slightly modified the code so it doesn't call to .cuda() and use CPU instead of GPU.

You can put an image , a video and build a fake video from it.
